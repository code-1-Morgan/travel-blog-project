## How It's Made:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Fully responsive for all screen sizes

## Lessons Learned:
Through this project, I became more familiar with using the flexbox to arrange items on the page. I also spent a lot of time learning how to change the positioning and sizing of the background image on the landing page.
